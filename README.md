# PhotoApp

I created this app as a project following CodeWithChris's course. The app signs the user in with an email
address and password and then takes them to a tab controller where they have a feed of all users who've posted 
photos, a tab to add photos, and then a settings tab to sign out.

This course created the app in Storyboard with Swift 5.

Skills learned/used for this course include:
* Firebase, Firestore, FireAuth, and FireStorage
* Setting up login screens and saving user states
* Using FireStorage to store photos and post them to a feed
